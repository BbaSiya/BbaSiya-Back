해당 사업자는 최근 일부 언론에 입장문을 내고, “법적 요건을 충족했음에도 ‘진입도로 길이 50m 초과’를 이유로 도시계획위원회 심의 대상으로 지정됐다”고 주장했다.

그러나 시 도시계획위원회는 국토의 계획 및 이용에 관한 법률 시행령 제57조를 근거로 “진입도로가 50m를 초과할 경우 도시계획위원회 심의 대상이 되는 것은 명백한 법령 규정”이라며 이 같은 주장이 사실과 다르다고 지적했다."

용인시 도시계획위원회는 '국토의 계획 및 이용에 관한 법률' 시행령 제57조에 따라 진입도로 길이가 50m를 넘는 경우 도시계획위원회 심의를 받도록 규정하고 있다고 밝혔다.

또한, 사업자가 ""사업에 직접적 이해관계를 가진 인사들이 심의에 참여한다""는 주장에 대해서도 용인시는 도시계획위원회가 민간 전문가로 구성되며, 이해관계자는 심의에서 배제된다고 반박했다."
